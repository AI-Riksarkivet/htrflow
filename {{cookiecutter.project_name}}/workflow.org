* Workflows
** Region_Line_Transcription workflow
    1. Load models
    2. Instantiate the inferencer (same input, same output-format)
    3. Predict_regions
    4. Post-process regions
        a. Filter_overlapping_regions
        b. Order_regions
    5. Crop regions_imgs
    6. Predict_lines
    7. Postprocess lines
    8. Crop line imgs
    9. Transcribe the lines with the htr model
    10. Combine result
        a. Polygons for the regions, in relation to the entire imgs
        b. Masks for the regions
        c. Polygons and masks for the lines, coordinates to be in respect to the orignal
        d. Text for each line
        e. Confidence scores for all predictions
        f. Ordering of the regions and the lines should be reflected result structure
