## dataset – Contributions

The AI models used in HTRFLOW is the result of a collaborative effort, involving the National Archives in both Sweden and Finland, in partnership with the Stockholm City Archives, Jämtlands läns fornskriftsällskap, citizen science volunteers and researchers from Stockholm and Uppsala Universities.

Several datasets have been created by participants through Citizen Science using the Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) software, Transkribus, provided by [READ-COOP SCE](https://readcoop.eu/) .
