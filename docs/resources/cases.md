## Seamless Access to Transcribed Text: Swedish National Archives' UniversalViewer Customization

!!! warning "Work in progress"

    Riksarkivet's UniversalViewer is still under development, with an estimated finish the end of this year.

This project aims to make the archival documents held by the Swedish National Archives, transcribed using Htrflow, accessible to everyone in a convenient and effortless way. To achieve this, the National Archives is utilizing the community-developed, open-source media viewer UniversalViewer, capable of displaying images, audio, video, and even 3D versions of digitized and born-digital cultural heritage collections.
UniversalViewer is built on the IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) standard for interoperable images. By utilizing a IIIF Content Search API endpoint, the National Archives make the transcribed text from Htrflow accessible for users through UniversalViewer.
In October 2024, the National Archives are launching a new customized version of UniversalViewer 4 (UV4), which includes a function to search within transcriptions of archival documents displayed in the viewer. This function enables researchers, students, and the general public to interact with the documents held by the National Archives in a new and efficient way â€“ without needing to decipher old handwriting. Users can search the archival documents and view the image of the original document next to the transcribed text.

- The National Archives are contributing these new functions to the main UV4 GitHub repository. Key features of the National Archives UV4 include:
- Search Pane: A new search pane on the left to search and display hits, with text snippets, within the archival document.
- Transcribed Text Pane: A new pane on the right displaying the transcribed text next to the image of the original archival document.
- Highlighting Function: A function that highlights the search hits both in the image and in the text snippets in the search pane.
- Image Adjustments: Tools for users to adjust image settings (saturation, contrast, light) within the viewer.
- User-Friendly Features: Options to print, download, and copy files, transcribed text, and metadata in user-friendly ways within the viewer.
